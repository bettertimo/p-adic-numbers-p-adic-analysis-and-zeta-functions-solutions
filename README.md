This is a partial solution guide to the exercises from the book *p-adic Numbers, p-adic Analysis, and Zeta-Functions* (2nd ed.) by Neal Koblitz. Since this paper was done by myself solely, there's no guarantee that all proofs are 100% correct. If you find some mistakes or even just one typo, please contact me by email. I would be very grateful. Feel free to download the whole PDF file!
